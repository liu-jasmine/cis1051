#### Project title

Worm Game


#### Comments
This was a very challenging project. Some twists I put on the original Snake Game to my Worm Game was I added and 
changed the graphics, made a loading title page and added a replay or exit option. This game was built off of the 
pygame module which was something new. It had a lot of functions that I did not understand, so I had to figue out 
what they did. Debugging and the process of trying to understand each line and function did get frustrating, but
searching online or asking around helped. In the end, this was a very rewarding and satisfying project. I really 
like game design!

There are still some bugs while playing the game, but I put all effort into this! I am really proud of it and I
hope others that play it can enjoy it, too!
